#This is a musical chair game. In this game there will be n number of 
#participants moving clockwise around a set of chairs organized in a circle
# while a music will be played in the background.
# We will control the music using random numbers between 0-3.If the generated 
# random number is 1, we will stop the music and if the number of participants
# who are still in the game is n, the participant at position (n/2) will be 
# eliminated. Each time a participant is eliminated, a chair will be removed. 
#The game will end when there will be only one participant.
